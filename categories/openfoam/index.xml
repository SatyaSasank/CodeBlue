The aim of this project is to create a custom solver in OpenFOAM that solves a transport equation for a scalar named s.
OBJECTIVES:
The solver must be modified from icoFoam which is present in $FOAM/applications/solvers/incompressible/icoFoam. The case should be a scalar quantity &amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; that is being transported by velocity u and the transport equation is represented by {del u }/{del t } + nabla. (us) = 0 The case must be modified from $FOAM_TUTORIALS/incompressible/icoFoam/cavity.</description></item></channel></rss>
