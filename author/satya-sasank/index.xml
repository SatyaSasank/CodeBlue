Aim of this project is to simulate Isentropic flow through a quasi 1D subsonic-supersonic nozzle.
OBJECTIVES :
The objectives of this project are
To solve the equations that govern the flow through a supersonic nozzle for both conservative and non conservative forms.
To find the differences between them by comparing their solutions.
Steady-state distribution of primitive variables inside the nozzle. Time-wise variation of the primitive variables.
Variation of Mass flow rate distribution inside the nozzle at different time steps during the time-marching process.</description></item></channel></rss>
