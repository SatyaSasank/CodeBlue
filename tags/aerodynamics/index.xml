This project aims to simulate the flow over Ahmed body in Ansys Fluent.
OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:
*Generate Velocity and pressure contours.
*Calculate the drag coefficient plot for a refined case.
*Generate the vector plot clearly showing the wake region. *Perform the grid independency test and evaluate the values of drag and lift with each case. THEORY
What is an Ahmed body?
The Ahmed body is a geometric shape first proposed by S.</description></item><item><title>FSAE Car Project</title><link>https://satyasasank.github.io/CodeBlue/posts/fsae_car/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2022 15:12:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://satyasasank.github.io/CodeBlue/posts/fsae_car/</guid><description>AIM:
The aim of this project is to simulate the flow around an FSAE car in converge.
OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:
*Clean up the geometry. *Flag the parts as separate boundaries.
*Create a virtual wind tunnel.
*Run the simulation for two different types of Races.
